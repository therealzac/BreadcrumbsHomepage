            <p class="subtitle bold">Why did we decide to found Breadcrumbs?</p>
            <p class="subtitle">The internet is really only 30 years old, and there are a number of critical changes we believe are inevitable to make the internet a safer and more useful tool. One of these changes is a shift towards users' awareness and control of their data, which has been happening for a number of years already. We think it's important that users understand the power of their own data and what can be ascertained from it, and it's a mission that drives us to make a massive positive impact on the world.</p>

            <p class="title">What is a decentralized VPN?</p>
            <p class="subtitle">A decentralized VPN (dVPN) is a virtual private network service that runs on a blockchain, making it qualitatively more secure than a centralized VPN. Standard VPN providers may store logs of your internet traffic (even if they say they don't) because all of your activity is routed through one of their servers. A dVPN distributes your internet traffic through a peer-to-peer network of thousands of nodes, so your activity inherently cannot be tracked.</p>
