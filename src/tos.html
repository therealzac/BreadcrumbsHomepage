Our mission is to provide a platform in which people and businesses can publish and post content and connect with other people and organizations without worrying about how their data is being collected and shared with third parties, including, but not limited to, advertisers.  Our goal is to give people control over their data and the ability to monetize their own data.  Indeed, we believe that people, not only large billion-dollar corporations, should be able to profit off of their data.
We do not sell your personal data to advertisers, and we do not share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address, or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us written permission to do so and third parties with whom we may share your data with your consent will not be permitted to further sell, share, transfer, or otherwise disclose your data.
